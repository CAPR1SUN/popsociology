    <span id="iconDescription"><p>Game theory is a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.</p>We can use the interaction of asking someone out for a date as a simple example of game theory and how there are game-like aspects involved. If you are asking someone out on a date, you will probably have some kind of strategy to ‚Äúwin‚Äù (having the other person agree to go out with you) and ‚Äúget rewarded‚Äù (have a good time) at a minimal ‚Äúcost‚Äù to you (you don‚Äôt want to spend a large amount of money on the date or do not want to have an unpleasant interaction on the date).
</span>
    <span id="iconExample"><p>The use of the game theory has since expanded in the social sciences and has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well. Some scholars believe that they can actually predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied.</p></span>
