    <span id="iconDescription"><p>Critical Theory is a social theory that aims to critique and change society as a whole. Critical theories attempt to find the underlying assumptions in social life that keep people from fully and truly understanding how the world works.</p>
        Critical social theory constitutes an effort to rethink and reform Marxist social criticism; it characteristically rejects mainstream political and intellectual views, criticizes capitalism, promotes human liberation, and consequently attempts to expose domination and oppression in their many forms. The extent to which science and technology may be associated with domination and oppression has been a major theme of critical theory.

</span>
    <span id="iconExample"><p>The goal of critical theory is to give the general public information on issues that can cause oppression to groups of people. By drawing attention to an unfair practice, critical theory hopes that behaviors can correct the unbalanced systems that favor particular people.</p></span>
