    <span id="iconDescription"><p>The disengagement theory of ageing states that "aging is an inevitable, mutual withdrawal or disengagement, resulting in decreased interaction between the aging person and others in the social system he belongs to". The theory claims that it is natural and acceptable for older adults to withdraw from society.</p>It is notable for being the first social science theory of aging, and in part, because it was controversially received, sparked further development of social science research, and theories about the elderly, their social relationships, and their roles in society.
</span>
    <span id="iconExample"><p>An example of disengagement theory if an older adult who has heart disease may develop shortness of breath may be unable to continue daily walks with their friends. The older adult will develop less contact with friends which may lead to fading friendships.</p></span>
