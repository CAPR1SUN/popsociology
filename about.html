               <h3>What is this website about?</h3>
               <p>This website features the 25 essential sociology concepts that you need to know. It's easy to read and interesting, so no more attempting to read dense theory books and pretend that you're actually learning something.</p>

            <h3>Why Sociology?</h3>
            <p>Personally, sociology is one of the most important areas of study that every student must know. Some might say it's useless but in reality, learning about how society and humans work allow us to solve complex problems and make an impact.</p>

            <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
            <p>As I was searching for projects to make, I thought that I could try and make an educational website of my favorite subject, Sociology. As an aspiring sociologist who likes to dabble with technology, this project has helped me to apply both my skills in research and web development. </p>
