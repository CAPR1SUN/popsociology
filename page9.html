    <span id="iconDescription"><p>Social learning theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, emphasizes the importance of observing, modelling, and imitating the behaviors, attitudes, and emotional reactions of others. Social learning theory considers how both environmental and cognitive factors interact to influence human learning and behavior.</p>
        Social learning theory examples in everyday life are common, with one of the most evident being the behaviors of children, as they imitate family members, friends, famous figures and even television characters. If a child perceives there is a meaningful reward for such behavior, they will perform it at some point. Social media presents plenty of social learning examples with people imitating others whether acting a movie scene, copying dance moves from a music video, and not the least, the many social media challenges people attempt. This frenzied behavior is typically spurred by the desire to be socially accepted or liked.</span>
    <span id="iconExample"><p>Two areas of application of social learning theory in social work include research and intervention. Researchers can use the theory to understand how aggressiveness and violence can be transferred through observational learning. The theory can further be used to investigate how positive role models can foster desirable behaviors and promote social change.</p></span>
