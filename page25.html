    <span id="iconDescription"><p>British philosopher and sociologist, Herbert Spencer was a major figure in the intellectual life of the Victorian era. He was one of the principal proponents of evolutionary theory in the mid nineteenth century, and his reputation at the time rivaled that of Charles Darwin.</p>Spencer was initially best known for developing and applying evolutionary theory to philosophy, psychology and the study of society ‚Äî what he called his ‚Äúsynthetic philosophy.‚Äù He believed that the fundamental sociological classification was between military societies, in which cooperation was secured by force, and industrial societies, in which cooperation was voluntary and spontaneous.
