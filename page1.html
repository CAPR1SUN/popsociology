    <span id="iconDescription"><p>Sociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociologyâ€™s subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to religion, from the family to the state, from the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and from social stability to radical change in whole societies.</p>
        As a social science, studying sociology can prepare you for a variety of careers. It will provide you with the background education you need to understand social issues like social inequality in class in addition to criminology and the criminal justice system and various other social and work settings. "It will prepare you for the challenges and opportunities that present themselves to you as you develop a rich and rewarding life," said North Central College Professor of Sociology Lou Corsino. "This is what the well-known sociologist, C. Wright Mills, meant when he wrote so passionately about the 'promise of sociology.'"</span>
    <span id="iconExample"><p>Sociology provides critical insight and perspective to the solution of social problems. Sociology has changed our outlook with regard to the problems of crime, its causes and consequences. Sociology is of great importance to the understanding of international problems.</p></span>
